# VR_Color

A VR game developed during my time at Gamechuck, designed to assess players' color perception in an immersive virtual environment.

# How It Works:

- At the start of the game, players enter their personal information in a user creation menu.
- After setup, players engage in a series of interactive VR challenges designed to evaluate how well they can distinguish colors.
  
This project combines engaging gameplay with functional diagnostics, offering a unique and immersive experience for users.
